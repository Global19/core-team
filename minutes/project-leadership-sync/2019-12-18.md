# Rust Project Leadership Sync Meeting

## Topic

In today's meeting, we diverted from the "status update" format
and instead had a conversation about how best to have this meeting
going forward. The consensus was that the current format didn't
seem optimal, and we decided to experiment with an alternative:

* Create two zulip streams to use for async communication
    * team leads (public) -- preferred choice, public
    * team leads (private) -- private stream, no history
* We can give major updates or raise questions there
* We have another sync meeting scheduled for 1 month from now to review

## Notes

* We could do regular updates in some async fashion but do regular posts to the blog
* These don't have to be compiled, teams could update separately and post to blog
    * already happening to some extent
    * (but does everyone read?)
* Other forms of communication?
    * In this meeting, WG asking the teams for things
    * Communication between teams, particularly around technical things
        * In principle core team might do this but 
    * This could well be handled by a separate stream
        * Zulip might be better because topics
        * maybe a private steam? maybe a public/private stream?
* Observation
    * since meeting started, Niko (and simulacrum) feel somewhat better informed
    * but we've tended towards "larger" events in these meetings, maybe a lighter weight forum might allow for something else
    * maybe there are specific pairings (e.g., embedded+lang) that should be in more common conversation
* Topics at the interesction of technical + social 
    * interesting to have a place where one can make observations that you wouldn't want to make properly
        * private stream for team leads might help
        * specifically, one without full history
    * would people be interested in "mediation consultations"
    * having a defined escalation path might be helpful
* Specific proposal that seems to be gaining currency
    * team leads (public)
    * team leads (private)
* Document purpose of channels
    * and especially privacy expectations from "private" channel
* Could also be used for teams to communicate with one another
    * e.g., no place for a team member to go and see "what is changing" for the teams and for the project
    * some kind of "announcement"-like channel
        * kind of a twitter
        * could be on Discord, since not everybody uses it
* Can we bridge?
    * Maybe but skepticism
* But also a desire not to force people to use Zulip
    * But it's not clear if a discord will work in the same way
* This has always been an experiment, always the option to eagerly create and see how it goes
    * maybe we schedule next meeting for 1 month 
    * in the meantime, create two zulip streams as an experiment
