# Core Team Meetings

The Core team is conducting an experiment to record ‘non-sensitive’ parts of Core team triage meetings (where we cover current topics of relevance to the core team and track our actions on them) and sharing them with the community on the Rust YouTube channel to provide greater transparency into how we work.

The posting of these recordings will potentially lag by up to a month, and we’re not currently committing to doing a recording every meeting. We will endeavor to post an update here at most a month after every meeting either with a recording or an indication that there will not be one forthcoming (and ideally a reason why).

Please file issues or email core-team at rust-lang.org with any questions.
